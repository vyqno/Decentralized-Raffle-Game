# Decentralized Raffle Project

This project implements a decentralized raffle system using Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and Chainlink Automation.

## Project Overview

The decentralized raffle allows users to enter a raffle by purchasing tickets. The winner of the raffle is chosen in a provably fair and random manner using Chainlink VRF. The raffle process, from opening to winner selection, is automated using Chainlink Automation.

## Features

- **Decentralized:** The raffle is built on a smart contract, making it transparent and resistant to censorship.
- **Provably Fair:** Chainlink VRF ensures that the winner is selected using a verifiable random number, preventing any manipulation.
- **Automated:** Chainlink Automation handles the state transitions of the raffle, such as opening the raffle, closing it, and triggering the winner selection process.
- **Secure:** The smart contract is designed to be secure and robust.
